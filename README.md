# GraphQL Social Media App

I Made this Social Media application with Next.js as a main framework with Typescript for type safe,
I used GraphQL insted of REST APIs, Apollo Server handles backend side and Apollo Client takes the frontend side,
for styling I used Tailwind CSS with Shadcn UI, for the database I used mongodb to store main data with cloudinary for save media.

## Upcomming features:

- give each user ability to create, update and delete stories.
- make a section to show user's stories on top of his profile with slider.
- make section on top of home page to show friends stories with slider.
- I will use vercel cron jobs for remove "stories" after 24h from it's publish date.
