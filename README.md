# GraphQL Social Media App

I Made this Social Media application with Next.js as a main framework with Typescript for type safe,
I used GraphQL insted of REST APIs, Apollo Server handles backend side and Apollo Client takes the frontend side,
for styling I used Tailwind Css with Shadcn UI, for the database I used mongodb to store application data, and I used vercel cron jobs for remove "stories" after 24h from it's publish date,
